          <h5>Flumbo</h5>
          <p>My personal favorite on the monsters. He's heavily inspired by the Pokemon Slugma.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="illustration">
          <img src="assets/monsters-02.png" alt="Illustration 2" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
          <h5>Rocco</h5>
          <p>I was thinking about making something geometric. I didnt really think about what I was doing, I just made him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/monsters-03.png" alt="Illustration 3" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Red</h5>
            <p>I made this guy when I loaded up Illustrator for the first time. I was figuring out the software.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/monsters-04.png" alt="Illustration 4" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Jubily</h5>
            <p>I figured out that Illustrator has some 3D features, and I felt like I had to make something with it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/monsters-05.png" alt="Illustration 5" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Goofball</h5>
            <p>I made this guy after I looked over at the person next to me, and saw something similar on his screen that I really liked.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/monsters-06.png" alt="Illustration 6" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Zumbo</h5>
            <p>I wanted to see if I could make a humanoid and make it look good. I probably shouldve done something similar, but he still looks good.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/monsters-07.png" alt="Illustration 7" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Blub</h5>
            <p>This guy is inspired by the Puddle Slime from Slime Rancher. I made him because I had a lot of extra time in class.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/posterTwo-1.png" alt="Illustration 8" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Gigglesaurus I</h5>
            <p>This is the first iteration of my Gigglesaurus poster. I wanted to make some kind of Nasa-esque poster</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/posters-02.png" alt="Illustration 9" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Gigglesaurus II</h5>
            <p>This is the second iteration of my Gigglesaurus poster. This one is by far my favorite because theres a lot of fine details.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/posters-03.png" alt="Illustration 10" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Gigglesaurus III</h5>
            <p>This is the third iteration of my Gigglesaurus poster. I'm a bit unsure of this one, but I still think the FX turned out well.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/Low Poly project.png" alt="Illustration 11" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Silly Goose</h5>
            <p>I spent way too much time on this one. I knew this would get printed out when I was finished, so I decided to make a goose because my girlfriend really likes geese, and I wanted to give this to her.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/portfolio art.png" alt="Illustration 12" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Leviathan</h5>
            <p>I was having some ideas of how I could make this website, and I originally wanted some cool full-page illustrations with some text on the side to showcase my stuff. Ended up not working out, but I think this turned out really well so it's in here now.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/foodTruckFinal.png" alt="Illustration 13" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Groovy Truck</h5>
            <p>I think this is my most boring one yet. I think the logo couldve been better, and the pattern on the truck was alright at best. Not what I originally had in mind when making this.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="illustration">
            <img src="assets/Cards_Card.png" alt="Illustration 14" onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
            <h5>Card</h5>
            <p>The back of a playing card I designed for a card game idea</p>
